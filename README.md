# The-Gaming-Room

In this course, the client was The Gaming Room. They wanted a web-based gaming application that would allow multiple teams and players to participate in a game environment similar to Draw It or Lose It. The main requirement was to design a system that supported multiple users, enforced unique team and player names, and followed good object-oriented design principles. The system needed to be scalable, secure, and capable of running across different operating platforms. My role was to design the software architecture and create a complete software design document that clearly explained how the system would be structured before development began.

One thing I believe I did particularly well in this documentation was breaking down the technical decisions in a way that connected back to the client’s needs. Instead of just listing technical components, I focused on explaining why certain design patterns (like the singleton pattern for the game service) were important. I also clearly compared operating platforms and justified the final recommendation. That helped make the document feel intentional instead of just theoretical.

Working through the design document before coding was honestly one of the most helpful parts of the process. It forced me to slow down and think through structure, constraints, and scalability instead of just jumping into writing code. As someone who usually wants to start building immediately, this helped me understand why planning matters. By mapping out classes, relationships, and requirements ahead of time, the development phase becomes more organized and less frustrating.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would probably expand more on security considerations and cloud deployment strategies. While I covered them at a high level, I could improve that section by including more detailed explanations about authentication, data protection, and future scalability in a distributed environment. That would make the document stronger from an enterprise-level perspective.

When interpreting the user’s needs, I focused on the core requirement of uniqueness and multiplayer functionality. I made sure that the design supported unique identifiers for games, teams, and players, and I structured the classes in a way that prevents duplication. Considering the user’s needs is critical in software design because if the system doesn’t solve the client’s actual problem, the technical quality doesn’t matter. Good design starts with understanding what the user is trying to accomplish.

My approach to designing the software was structured and requirement-driven. I analyzed the client’s goals, identified constraints, selected appropriate design patterns, and compared system environments before making recommendations. In the future, I would continue using UML diagrams, requirement analysis, and design pattern evaluation as core techniques. I would also incorporate more real-world deployment research, especially as I continue building toward a career in cybersecurity, where secure and scalable system design is essential.

Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of software architecture, object-oriented design, and the importance of planning before development.
